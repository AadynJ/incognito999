# incognito
Wipes some personal information from your Nintendo Switch by removing it from PRODINFO.

## Purpose
a) It enables your switch can go online while worrying slightly less about a ban.

b) It prevents malicious homebrew applications from stealing your personal certificate.

## Disclaimers
* This application does not remove all personal information from your Switch, and should not be treated as a true preventative measure against getting banned.

* Always have a NAND backup. I am not responsible for any bricks or bans. Use at your own risk, as this is an experimental program.

* This application backs up your PRODINFO to the SD root. You should keep this backup in a more secure location, and not leave it on the SD card where malicious applications can read it.
